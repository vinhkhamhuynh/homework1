<h1>Task</h1>
*As a junior developer, I've been tasked with refactoring Horiseon's website. My task is to make changes in HTML and css files so that the website meets accessibility standards. To accomplish this, I've make amend to the HTML and CSS files.

For the HTML file I've:
*implemented Semantic HTML elements
*included alt attributes to image elements
*corrected the structure of HTML elements so they follow a logical structure
*added a descriptive title
*made sure all links work properly

For the CSS file I've:
*consolidated CSS selectors and properties
*organized CSS file to follow semantic structure
*properly commented the CSS file
